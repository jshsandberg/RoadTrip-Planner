# RoadTrip Planner
[![languages used](https://img.shields.io/github/languages/count/spencer-alan/project-2)]()

## Description
This is a web app that allows users to click on a state and view notes that they have created about that state and can either plan ahead or remember what was fun to do there if they were to ever go back again. Currently, there is only one public website that can be accessed by anyone, but in the future will have designated profiles so you can see only what you have done. We are also going to connect people with more resources when they view a state so they can have some starting point for their planning.
